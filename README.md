# Assignment Notes

0) After I deployed I noticed that I was having trouble configuring the spotify redirt url for github pages.
   
   It was working for me very well locally. I willl try to fix this on Sunday.

1) The app is deployed on github pages at: https://danield770.github.io/spotify-search/

2) The app is responsive with 3 breakpoint layouts, so be sure to resize to various widths

3) The app is easily themable by simply altering the hue custom property in the developer tools (see screen shot)

   Of course, in a real app, there would be the appropriate UI for the user to choose the theme
   
4) I wanted to use a custom hook to fetch the data, but I was having an issue with authentication which I couldn't figure out.

5) Regarding lazy loading of the images: 

I have added the loading='lazy' native property (see [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img#attr-loading)) which has pretty good browser support (see [caniuse](https://caniuse.com/loading-lazy-attr))


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
